Description: This was my submission for CIS 112 Programming II Java Review

For this project, we were tasked with creating an Ecosystem full of bears and fish represented by “b” and “f” respectively on an array with 30 spaces. The program will randomly fill up the array with b, f, and n (for empty) and after an iteration, the elements will shift. If a f or b “collides” with a n, the n would become a f or b. If a b “collides” with a f, the f becomes a b which represents a bear eating a fish.
